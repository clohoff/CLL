This is a workflowr repository for the project: The transcriptional landscape of drug effects in leukemia and lymphoma. This project is designed to assess the transcriptome landscape of drug effects in leukemia and lymphoma in a high-throughput manner. The study will expose different blood cancer entities to a panel of target-inhibiting drugs that abrogate signaling of important survival pathways in B cell leukemia and lymphoma.
