This is a workflowr repository for the Masters Thesis "The transcriptomic signatures of drug perturbations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)".
This project is about a high-throughput gene expression perturbation screen with ten drugs and 116 patients. The transcriptomic changes were assessed using shallow 3'-end RNA sequencing. The study will expose different blood cancer entities to a panel of target-inhibiting drugs that abrogate signaling of important survival pathways in B cell leukemia and lymphoma. 


### The data is stored on the EMBL server:

* Raw fastq files: /g/huber/projects/nct/cll/RawData/RNASeq/drugSeq 

* Processed outputs (bam files, salmon outputs, fastQC outputs and htseq outputs: /g/huber/projects/nct/cll/ProcessedData/RNAseq/drugSeq

* The R data files that contain the DESeq object of the RNAseq count data and metadata are stored at: /g/huber/projects/nct/cll/ProcessedData/RNAseq/objects/drugSeq/
